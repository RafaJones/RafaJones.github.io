##The Problem 

Using accelerometer data from 4 places during an exercise (arm, forearm,belt, and the dumbell itself) across six participants, can the **quality** of the exercise be predicted? 

This is the "classe" variable in the Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset. Thank you to,

For creating the dataset under creative commons. 

##Explaining my Model Choices 

Seeing the dimensions of the data I was immediately wary of overfitting, but upon examining pieces of the data and cleaning it of unusable features I narrowed it down to 53 features (removing the NA, character, time components and user names). I did this under the assumption that the time dependencies of the accelerometer would be negligible in predicting grossly incorrect exercises (as explained by the experimenters, a professional was there to monitor the exercise and ensure safe, but dramatic incorrect motions). 

I started with a computationally friendly Linear Discriminant Analysis to benchmark my in-sample error (70%). From there, I used parallel computing (as suggested by the discussion boards) to create a more accurate Random Forest Model. Upon seeing that it had perfect in-sample accuracy, I decided against creating an ensemble model and went straight to testing the RF model on a validation set I had already separated. At 99.34% accuracy, it would succeed in getting all of the 20 final tests correct around 90% of the time.


##Downloading and Cleaning the data 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)

trainURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"

#the test set will be used at the end 
testURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

download.file(trainURL, destfile = "./trainWLED.csv")

weightlift <- read.csv("./trainWLED.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE, na.strings = " ")
                      

```

When downloading the data a large amount of NAs and character classes form (when stringsAsFactors = FALSE). So to check if those values mean anything, I've found the columns that become characters and I'll identify if they're useful. 

```{r}

#160 is classe predictor variable 
weightlift[,160] <- as.factor(weightlift[,160])

charcolumnlist = NULL 
for(i in 1:159){
if(class(weightlift[,i]) == "character"){ 
        charcolumnlist <- c(charcolumnlist,i)
        }
}

```

re-downloading weightlift and using stringsAsFactors = TRUE, I'll select only these rows and see if they are usable. 
```{r}
possunusable <- read.csv("./trainWLED.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE, na.strings = " ")
poss2 <- possunusable[,charcolumnlist]

```

As expected, besides the username, cvtd_timestamp, and new_window columns, the other 100 columns are NA over 99% of the time. I'll remove those columns. 

```{r}
rmcolumnlist <- charcolumnlist[-c(1:3)] #the first, second, and third values 

weightsdata <- weightlift[,-rmcolumnlist]
weightsdata[,60] <- as.factor(weightsdata[,60])

rm(poss2, possunusable) #reduce clutter


```


##Building a Model 
To start, I want to make an anonymous model (remove names) that doesn't use time data as a benchmark for other models to beat. I will ensemble the models as well, depending on their accuracies. 

```{r}
weightstrain <- weightsdata[8:60] #no windows, names, or time stamps 

set.seed(4)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(weightstrain$classe, p = .7, list = FALSE)

training <- weightstrain[inTrain,]
testing <- weightstrain[-inTrain,]

LDAmodel <- train(classe ~., method = "lda", data = training)
LDApred <- predict(LDAmodel, newdata = training)

confusionMatrix(LDApred,training$classe)

```

70% accuracy is low so I'll test an RF model and compare. Using the parallel and doParallel packages as suggested by **https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/pml-randomForestPerformance.md**

Note: *Cross Validation* is included in the trainControls for the RF Model.
```{r}
library(parallel)
library(doParallel)

cluster <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1)  # using code from link
registerDoParallel(cluster)                # using code from link 

tcControls <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, allowParallel = TRUE)

RFmodel <- train(classe ~ ., method = "rf", data = training, trControl = tcControls)

stopCluster(cluster)  # using code from link
registerDoSEQ()       # using code from link 

RFpred <- predict(RFmodel, newdata = training)
confusionMatrix(RFpred, training$classe)

```

Using parallel processing to reduce my runtime to about 15 minutes, the confusionMatrix shows 100% accuracy - possibly overfitting or the worst case scenario, a classe proxy is still inside the dataset. 

I'll use the test set to check the results. 

```{r}
RFtestpred <- predict(RFmodel, newdata = testing)

confusionMatrix(RFtestpred, testing$classe)


```

##Out of Sample Error and Cross Validation 
99.34% Accuracy on the testing set~ Thus an out of sample error of 1-Accuracy is estimated to be .66%. Although the 95% confidence interveral for the accuracy is (.991,.9953) so the out of sample error is between .66 with a 95% confidence interval of (.47%,.9%). 

```{r}
RFmodel
```
10 - fold cross validation was used in the random forest model.
